# keras-feed-forward-neural-network-demo
Implementing a Feed Forward Neural Network using Keras.

In this project, we perform EDA on our data set, construct a feed forward neural network to classify signals as either gamma or hadron, and then fine tune the hyperparameters to optimise the test accuracy.

Data set used for this project is the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Data Set.

Information on the data set, as well as the data itself is available at
